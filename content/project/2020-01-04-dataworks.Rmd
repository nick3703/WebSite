In 2019 I gave an invited talk at the [DATAWorks conference](https://dataworks.testscience.org/) on how we educate future Army leaders in data science and statistics.  I discussed the new Applied Statistics and Data Science major as well as innovations in teaching introductory statistics.  Slides are below.
