There's a couple of ways you could do this, one way would be to run:

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
sv.diagram<-data.frame(response="My Response",explained_variation="My Explained Variation",unexplained_variation="Thing 1, Thing 2, Thing 3")
x <- knitr::kable(sv.diagram, "html")
column_spec(x, 1:3, width = "20em")
```

One thing to change when you do this in your markdown file is you would want to do `knitr::kable(sv.diagram, "latex")` as opposed to `html`.  You can also play around with the `width` option in `column_spec()`
