Welcome to MA376!  Prior to class please ensure you have a \textbf{working} version of R [Available Here](https://www.r-project.org/) and R Studio, [Available Here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).  THe majority of this course will be conducted in R, but if you want to use Python, there's nothing stopping you!

In R Studio run `library(tidyverse)`  If you get an error, you need to install the package via `install.packages("tidyverse")`.  If you need a referesher on `tidyverse`, I'd highly recommend [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
