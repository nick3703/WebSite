<p>Welcome to MA376! Prior to class please ensure you have a  version of R <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">Available Here</a> and R Studio, <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">Available Here</a>. THe majority of this course will be conducted in R, but if you want to use Python, there’s nothing stopping you!</p>
<p>In R Studio run <code>library(tidyverse)</code> If you get an error, you need to install the package via <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code>. If you need a referesher on <code>tidyverse</code>, I’d highly recommend <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R4DS</a>.</p>
