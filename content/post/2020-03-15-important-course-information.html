<p>MA 376ers -</p>
<p>In case you do not have email access, we will be holding class remotely starting likely 19 March. I plan on conducting the class either via Teams or via Blackboard Connect. I will continue to post the course notes on the website and will conduct class in the normal manner.</p>
<p>If you have not done so already please send me an email letting me know if you have any issues accessing either blackboard or Teams.</p>
<p>Finally, the next exploration will be due <em>COB on 19 March</em> please turn it in on here: <a href="http://usma.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a></p>
