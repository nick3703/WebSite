<p>It’s easy in the study of statistics to get lost in the definitions. Oftentimes we throw around words without ever really thinking about what they mean. Two of the terms that we will quite a bit in this course are parameters and statistics.</p>
<div id="parameter" class="section level2">
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<p>I like to think of a parameter as an unobserved value that fully names a distribution. To put a bit of meat on this definition let’s consider our data coming from a Normal distribution. The probability density function for a Normal distribution is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(y_i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\mu)^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Here there are two parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. These parameters control the center and the scale of our bell shaped curve.</p>
<p>How does this relate to our statistical modeling approach we’ve been doing up to this point? Well, if we assume</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_i=\mu+\epsilon_i\]</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma)\)</span>, then our data follows the PDF above.</p>
<p>Therefore there are two parameters in this model that we would need to estimate from our data, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. We can think of our data, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> as having been generated by this distribution.</p>
<p>If we extend this to our two means model our data then have PDF</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(y_{i,j})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\mu_i)^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall we can also write this as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(y_{i})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_i)^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(x_i=1\)</span> if in group 1, else <span class="math inline">\(x_i=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here we see that our data generating mechanism has three parameters to be estimated, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. If we know those three parameters we know everything we could possibly know about the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>So if these are parameters, what are Statistics? A statistic is virtually any function of our data. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(g(\boldsymbol{y})=\max(\boldsymbol{y})\)</span> is a statistic, or <span class="math inline">\(h(\boldsymbol{y})=\bar{y}\)</span> is a statistic.</p>
<p>So if ANYTHING is a statistic, how does this help us? Well, in general what we want to calculate are statistics that help us either answer a question of interest or to estimate a parameter.</p>
<p>For instance, in our single means model we might want to use <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> as a statistic because it helps us estimate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. However, this doesn’t help us estimate <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> so perhaps we would use <span class="math inline">\(S^2=\frac{\sum_i (y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}\)</span> as another statistic.</p>
<p>In the multiple means model we have three parameters to estimate so we may need three statistics to help us here. So this is helpful, but we also want to answer questions like, is our model better than the null model. Here we will have multiple statistics that help address the question of interest. For instance we have <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> as a statistic. Note that <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is a function of our data so it is a statistic.</p>
<p>However, this brings us to another important note on what statistic we might want to calculate. It will be extremely beneficial to use statistics that have . For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma)\)</span>, then we know the PDF of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and in turn we know that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\bar{y}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}\sim t_{n-1}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> would be a good statistic if we  the distribution of it. However, we unfortunately don’t have a distribution in general for <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. One way around this is to simulate a distribution for <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the scent data from class</p>
<p>Here’s our <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
scent.dat&lt;-read.table(&quot;http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2/data/OdorRatings.txt&quot;,header=TRUE)
scent.mod&lt;-lm(rating~condition,data=scent.dat)
our.stat&lt;-summary(scent.mod)$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>If scent doesn’t matter then we could shuffle our conditions around</p>
<pre class="r"><code>M &lt;- 1000
emp.est&lt;-data.frame(shuffle=seq(1,M),stat=NA)#Blank data set to fill in
for(i in 1:M){
  scent.dat.rearr = scent.dat %&gt;%
    mutate(new_cond=sample(scent.dat$condition))
  shuff.scent.mod&lt;-lm(rating~new_cond,data=scent.dat.rearr)
  emp.est[i,]$stat&lt;-summary(shuff.scent.mod)$r.squared
}</code></pre>
<p>So even though we don’t  the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> we know it sort of looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>emp.est %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=stat))+geom_histogram(bins=20)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-01-22-parameters-statistics-and-distributions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If we knew the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> then we could find the area of the curve to the right of OUR statistic to find how rare it would be to observe something as extreme or more extreme then what we observed. Here we can just count:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>emp.est %&gt;% filter(stat &gt; our.stat)%&gt;%
  summarize(p.val=n()/nrow(emp.est))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   p.val
## 1     0</code></pre>
