MA 376ers - 

In case you do not have email access, we will be holding class remotely starting likely 19 March.  I plan on conducting the class either via Teams or via Blackboard Connect.  I will continue to post the course notes on the website and will conduct class in the normal manner.

If you have not done so already please send me an email letting me know if you have any issues accessing either blackboard or Teams.

Finally, the next exploration will be due *COB on 19 March* please turn it in on here: [Blackboard](http://usma.blackboard.com)
